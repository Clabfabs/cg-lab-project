Balloon was a quick model I made to make one of my pictures. Is here if you like.

I have included the Blender file, as this is what I made it in. The obj file and mates for other formates, and a daz file if you use that. It's small simple and free. Though if you have some small easy modeling you need done, see my blog at the artzone.
